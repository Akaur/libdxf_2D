How to use this library
------------------------

Three steps to use this library:
STEP 1:
Create an object of dxf class with output filename with .dxf extension such as dxf file("CAD.dxf")
where file is an object that holds output filename "design.dxf".

STEP 2:
To create any entity, first we have to specify the points such as
  point pt1(x1, y1), pt2(x2, y2), ...., ptn(xn, yn);

where   point is a class and pt1, pt2, .., ptn are objects.

# For line entity _
Create an object of class line with four parameters such as
  line horizontal(pt1, pt2, "Layer[1-5]", file);

where pt1         -> starting point
      pt2         -> ending point
      Layer[1-5]  -> Layer1, Layer2, Layer3, Layer4 and Layer5.
                     One can specify any between these.
      file        -> draw  entity in output filename.


# For circle entity _
Similarly,
  circle box(pt1, radius, "Layer[1-5]", file);

where pt1     -> center of circle
      radius  -> radius of circle

== Hatching with circle entity ==

 # Pattern fill _
   circle box(pt1, radius, "Layer[1-5]", file, 0, "pattern_name", 
             pattern_color[1-256]);

where   0             -> flag for pattern fill
        pattern_name  -> choose from pattern_name_list
        pattern_color ->  color for hatching between 1-256

 # Solid fill
   circle box(pt1, radius, "Layer[1-5]", file, 1, solid_color[1-256]);

where   1           -> flag for solid fill
        solid_color -> color for hatching between 1-256


# For rectangle entity _
Similarly,
  rectangle square(pt1, pt2, "Layer[1-5]", file);

== Hatching with rectangle entity ==

 # Pattern fill _
   rectangle square(pt1, pt2, "Layer[1-5]", file, 0, "pattern_name", 
                    pattern_color[1-256]);

 # For solid fill
   rectangle square(pt1, pt2, "Layer[1-5]", file, 0, solid_color[1-256]);


STEP 3:
Save output file with save() function such as
  file.save();


How to RUN this
-----------------
* Save this file in test folder with extension .cpp such as "cad.cpp".

* Open the terminal, run
	$ cd testing

* Linking with shared library
	$ g++ -L./lib -Wall -o prog test/cad.cpp -ldxf_2D
	
* Make library available at runtime
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/:LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Run
	$ ./prog

Now you can open "CAD.dxf" with librecad.
